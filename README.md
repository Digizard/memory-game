Memory Game
===========

This project was made for the Udacity Front-End Nanodegree program. It allows the user to play the Memory card game, also known as Concentration. The user tries to find the matching pairs of cards.

How to Run
----------

Open `index.html` in your favorite browser.

How to Play
-----------

Find all matching pairs of cards. You may only view two cards at a time. The fewer moves it takes you, the higher your star rating.
